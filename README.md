# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project features a simple tic-tac-toe game created with JavaScript

## How To Play

You don't know how to play tic-tac-toe?
Two players play the game, and each player can select any cell. The first player to select matching cells in a row, column or diagonal wins.

## Contributing

The functionality of letting players play at the same time hasn't been added, you could contribute to that.
